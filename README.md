# ColorMyPhoto  
A prototype for a paid app which I was hoping to publish but ultimately the shortcomings in the algorithm, price per picture (compute time), and time to process each picture caused me to abandon the project.  Nonetheless, it is a working prototype and sometimes fun to play around with.  

# To run this app  
Clone or download the repository    
Sign up or use your own Algorthmia API key   
Add the key to the strings resources under the TODO    
Run!  

# Examples taken from within the app and received within the app as well
